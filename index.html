<H2> Playlist Recommendation Engines: </H2> 

  
<br>Through the decades, music has evolved considerably, reflecting changes in technology and tastes. However, what has also changed is how we access music. Radios, CDs and even MP3s have taken a backseat… We are now well into the era of music streaming, a means of accessing music and playlists online without actually purchasing the song or album.

<br> Enter Spotify; a music streaming platform that has revolutionized the way we access and listen to music. Users can opt to follow artists/friends or create and share playlists. The music streaming giant has grown to include approximately 191 million users as of December 2018, outperforming industry rivals such as Apple Music (56 millions users) and Pandora Radio (71 million users). It can be argued that, the driving force behind Spotify’s great success is the platform’s ability to recommend songs or playlists based on user listening history. The advent of companies such as Spotify, have bolstered the study of recommendation systems in the data science- business analytics world. The Spotify algorithm’s ability to recommend songs, predict tastes and personalize user experience have inspired students of data science to experiment with developing recommendation systems of their own.
