<H2> <B>Problem Statement:</B>
<P> We carried out our analysis on the million song subset consisting of 10000 songs from the source website since
the full dataset was too large for our computerâ€™s memory. We used the file hdf5_getters.py to access the fields in
HDF5 song files provided in the dataset, and extracted the following attributes for each song to a csv file:
title
artist_name
song_hotttnesss - about half of the songs were missing hotness values
artist_hotness
danceability - all values were 0 i.e not analyzed
energy - all values were 0 i.e not analyzed
duration
loudness
key
tempo
artist_num_tags - number of unique tags the artist received on musicbrainz.org
year
