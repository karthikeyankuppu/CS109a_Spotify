<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EDA allowed us to understand our data more in depth. We noticed some distinct trends in musical characteristics over the years, as well as the relationship between various variables.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the EDA revealed some surprises with regards to feature selection. Combining this analysis with a random forest variable importance test, we were able to narrow down our list of variables.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KNN and random forests performed similarly with an R squared of 0.9 and 0.89 respectively. Far out-performing the Decision Tree (R squared 0.78). We determine that KNN may be the best model for this type of analysis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommender system performs fairly well for certain playlists but poorly for others. The playlist clusters group playlists on significant audio features and we use that as a basis for finding the closest playlists to any given playlist.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Future Work</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, it would be pertinent to include data on genres, song language and maybe even attributes about artists. If we had further attributed on artists, we could perform cluster analysis on the artist data and generate an &ldquo;artist typology&rdquo;. We were unable to carry out this analysis since acquiring this data would require thorough and extensive scraping from websites and we could not complete it in the given time. Additionally, we thought that NLP analysis on lyrics may allow us to parse out richer insight on songs from their lyrics; this presents an area for future research.</span></p>
